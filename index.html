                        <h2>About Myself</h2>
                        <p>
                            My name is Huy, but you can call me William, I’m a student at Dalhousie University majoring in Computer Science with a focus on 
                            software development, system programming and cybersecurity. During my academic year, I have learned and completed multiple projects 
                            which contributed a lot to my knowledge and understanding of software development cycle and computer system.<br><br>
                            I’m person who is always yearn and eager to learn more and explore more knowledge and technology. I have strong passion and interest in both 
                            computer and aviation, that’s why outside of school, I spend most of my free time on learning new language, researching framework technology 
                            and computer system such as Linux, Haskell, C, or trying to improve my programming skill and logical thinking by practicing programming. I also spend 
                            some time on flying simulator such as Digital Combat Simulator, MSFS with a serious focus on learning the aircraft engineering, system, physics, especially about 
                            avionics because it incorporates the knowledge and passion I have in computer and aviation together to build an avionics such as Multi-Function Display.<br><br>
                            I have done many group projects, one of which is developing Android app with a group of seven people, which let me practice Agile methodologies and interact 
                            with Firebase Database. And most importantly it has enhanced my communication and teamwork skill
